# Basic Information About Structure the Game
# 1ยบ- The Pieces are saved in a dictionary which the key is a tuple containing the position of the piece and the value
# is the key itself;
# 2ยบ- You can exit the Game by pressing the key q;
# 3ยบ- I already made a function to change the position of a key but haven't implemented the event to do so.
